Level Order Traversal (Binary Tree)
-------------------------------------------------
Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, perform Level Order Traversal (Breadth First Traversal) and print/return the nodes level by level from left to right.

Approach / Idea
Level order traversal is done using a Queue.
Start by inserting the root into the queue.
Repeatedly:
Remove a node from the queue
Process it
Insert its left and right children (if present)
Continue until the queue becomes empty.

Algorithm (High-Level Steps)
If root is null, return.
Create an empty queue.
Add root to the queue.
While queue is not empty:
Remove front node.
Print/process its data.
Add left child if it exists.
Add right child if it exists.

Code
public void levelOrder(TreeNode root) {

    if (root == null)
        return;

    Queue<TreeNode> q = new LinkedList<>();
    q.add(root);

    while (!q.isEmpty()) {

        TreeNode cur = q.remove();
        System.out.print(cur.data + " ");

        if (cur.left != null)
            q.add(cur.left);

        if (cur.right != null)
            q.add(cur.right);
    }
}

Time Complexity

O(N)
Every node is visited exactly once.

Space Complexity

O(N)
In the worst case, the queue stores all nodes of the largest level.
