What is a Greedy Algorithm?
A Greedy Algorithm is an algorithmic approach that makes the best possible choice at each step, hoping that these local optimal choices will lead to a globally optimal solution.

👉 In simple words:
“Take the best option available right now, without worrying about future consequences.”

Key Characteristics
Local Optimal Choice
At every step, the algorithm chooses the option that seems best at that moment.

No Backtracking
Once a choice is made, it is never changed.

Efficiency
Greedy algorithms are usually fast and simple (often O(n) or O(n log n)).

Correctness Depends on Problem
Greedy works only for problems that satisfy:
Greedy Choice Property
Optimal Substructure

Important Properties
1. Greedy Choice Property
A globally optimal solution can be achieved by making a locally optimal choice at each step.

2. Optimal Substructure
The optimal solution of the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.

General Steps of a Greedy Algorithm
Sort or prioritize data (if needed).
Make the best local decision.
Reduce the problem size.

Classic Problems Using Greedy Algorithm
Activity Selection----->	Select activity with earliest finish time
Fractional Knapsack----->	Choose item with highest value/weight

Repeat until the problem is solved
